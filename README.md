# Business Data Analysis Group Project
This repository contains Python code for analyzing airline customer satisfaction data.

## Methodology
1. Data Processing: process of collecting, cleaning, and preparing raw data for analysis. In the airline customer satisfaction project, the team likely had to gather data from various sources such as surveys, social media, and customer reviews. They would then need to clean and prepare this data so that it can be used for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering: process of selecting and transforming relevant data features to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of a machine learning model. In the airline customer satisfaction project, the team may have needed to identify which features of the data were most relevant to customer satisfaction, such as flight duration, in-flight amenities, or overall flight experience. They may have also needed to engineer new features, such as combining data from multiple sources, to improve their model's accuracy.

3. Clustering: technique used to group data points with similar characteristics together. In the context of the airline customer satisfaction project, clustering could be used to group customers based on their satisfaction ratings or other relevant data. This could provide insights into which factors are most important for customer satisfaction and help the airline identify areas for improvement.

4. Classification: technique used to predict the category or class of a data point. In the airline customer satisfaction project, classification could be used to predict whether a customer is likely to be satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience. This could help the airline target marketing efforts towards customers who are most likely to have a positive experience and identify potential issues before they arise.


## Requirements

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

## Usage
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
